# Daily Task Organizer

This project helps you organize your daily tasks into two categories: **completed tasks** and **incomplete tasks**.

## How It Works

1. **Start of the Day:**  
   Create a checklist of tasks you want to accomplish.

2. **End of the Day:**  
   Review your checklist:
   - If a task is finished, move it to the **completed tasks** list.
   - If a task is not finished, move it to the **incomplete tasks** list.

By the end of each day, youâ€™ll have a clear overview of what you completed and what still needs attention.

## Features
